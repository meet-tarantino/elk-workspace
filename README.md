# ELK Workspace

This is a workspace for tinkering with the ELK logging stack.

notes:
  - `TT_PROJECTS` should be set appropriately for your local setup (in plugins/vars.sh)
  - the `gelf-address` on the `testapp` service definition is a moving target and needs to be updated as `logstash` hits the network
